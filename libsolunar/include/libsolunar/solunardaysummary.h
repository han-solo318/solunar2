/** Get a summary of the day's solunar events. The day is that which contains
 * the specified date. Since all times, input and output, are in UTC, it's
 * non-obvious why this method needs a timezone. The timezone does not
 * change any of the values returned (since all are time_t's), but it
 * controls the _range_ of times in which moonrises and moonsets are
 * searched. Since it's a _day_ summary, we want the events to take place
 * within 24 hours, in some specific timezone. Pass NULL for tz to use
 * local time. 
 *
 * The city argument is no used in calculations -- it's just stored for
 * future use. This argument can also legitimately be null 
 * The supplied time value is called 'date' to reinforce the fact that
 * only the date is required to work out a daily summary. However, the
 * exact time does have a slight impact, as it used to determine the
 * moon phase and distance. These things won't vary much during a day,
 * but they will vary a little. */
